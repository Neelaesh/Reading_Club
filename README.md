# Reading_Club
A responsive Single-Page Application (SPA) built to manage and showcase a virtual book club. The app includes a member gallery (main page), an admin management panel, and a simulated login system for protected access. It demonstrates CRUD operations, client-side routing, and component reusability in a clean and modular architecture.
